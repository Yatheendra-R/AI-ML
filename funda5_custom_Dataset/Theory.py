What is a custom dataset?
A custom dataset is a collection of data relating to a specific problem you're working on.
In essence, a custom dataset can be comprised of almost anything.

For example, our custom dataset might be images of food.
Or if we were trying to build a model to classify whether or not a text-based review on a website was positive or negative, our custom dataset might be examples of existing customer reviews and their ratings.
Or if we were trying to build a sound classification app, our custom dataset might be sound samples alongside their sample labels.
Or if we were trying to build a recommendation system for customers purchasing things on our website, our custom dataset might be examples of products other people have bought.

Custom datasets in the TorchVision, TorchText, TorchAudio and TorchRec domain libraries.
